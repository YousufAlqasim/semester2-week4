# Task 1 - character arrays and strings

1. **character arrays are not strings**

Small example showing how character arrays differ from strings.

Question: 
- Explain why printing the array as a string (%s) causes a strange result.
cause the string continues running until the null factor but sinc ethere isnt one and the arrays were next to eacher other to continues to the next array which had a null factor. 

- Hint: Think about how C data is stored in memory. 
- Test this by changing the second string to something other than "hello".
